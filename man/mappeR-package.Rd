\title{mappeR: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs}
\description{
Topological data analysis (TDA) is a method of data analysis that uses techniques from topology to analyze high-dimensional data. Here we implement Mapper, an algorithm from this area developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and Carlsson (2007) which generalizes the concept of a Reeb graph \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph}. The output graph is able to be visualized in R using 'igraph' or using a free network analysis software called 'Cytoscape', available for download from at \url{https://cytoscape.org/}.
