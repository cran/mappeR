#' Generate an overlapping cover of an interval
#'
#' This is a function that generates a cover of an interval \eqn{[a,b]} with
#' some number of (possibly) overlapping, evenly spaced, identical width subintervals.
#'
#' @param min_val The left endpoint \eqn{a}. A real number.
#' @param max_val The right endpoint \eqn{b}. A real number.
#' @param num_bins The number of cover intervals with which to cover the interval. A positive integer.
#' @param percent_overlap How much overlap desired between the cover intervals
#'  (the percent of the intersection of each interval with its immediate
#'   neighbor relative to its length, e.g., \eqn{[0,2]} and \eqn{[1,3]} would have \eqn{50\%} overlap).
#'   A real number between 0 and 100, inclusive.
#'
#' @return A 2D numeric array.

#'    \item left_ends - The left endpoints of the cover intervals.
